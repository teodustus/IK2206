A high quality key is a key which is tough or close to impossible to break with limited time. The key should be truly random to become harder to break.
There are many ways to determine if a key is a of good quality. 
To test if a key has good quality it is essential that the pattern has no regularities and that the ratio between 0 and 1 is close to 1:1.
You would like to check multiple keys to see if there are any recognisable faulties such as recurrant blocks and bit patterns.
I would assume that pattern analasys in dimensions > 2 could be present for more advanced tests.
